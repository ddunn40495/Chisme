# Chisme

    [Chisme App](https://chisme-proj.herokuapp.com/)

    **An app to add a post and comment on the post in real time!!**
    this is a full stack application using the **MERN**

##Technologies Used
    -**MERN**: Node.js, Mongoose, Express, and React
    -**Socket.IO**: This is what helped us create the comments in real time
    -**Heroku**: Used to deply our Application
    --**Trello** Kept track of all *TO DO* tasks
    -**Figma**: used as a wireframe for our app
    -**Font Awesome** great to add icons into the app
    -**Materialize** served as a default styling for forms and fonts.


##Apriach taken
    Started by setting up the database using mongoDB Atlas and a git repository for the group to create different branches and work off of it.
    Then tasks were divided for the front end, back end and new features to the application. The group was meeting everyday for stand ups, in order to communicate and address tasks or problems.
    The wireframe was helpful to picture the end result of the app as well as to discuss with the group if changes to initial model needed to be done.
    The app currently runs with full CRUD, (*create, read, update, delete), meaning is able to get the data from our mogo database, able to create posts and comments, able to delete posts and comments, and edit a post.
    Since we are using socket.io, One detail about the edit is that on submit, it will show the current messages in real time plus the ones from the database, (so there is a bug that needs to be addressed when possible), aside from that, the app runs smoothly with the current functionalities.


##For the Future
    In the left bar of the App, 3 buttons were created for user authentication, but no functionality was implemented. on click it display an alert saying that is currently under development. 
    Once user authentication will be added, then private messaging can be implemented into the app for 2 users, potentially later add an option for group chat messaging.
